summary    : A Python module to customize the process title
description: |
    The setproctitle module allows a process to change its title (as displayed by system tools such as ps and top). Changing the title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for example when a master process is forked: changing the childrenâ€™s title allows to identify the task each process is busy with. The technique is used by PostgreSQL and the OpenSSH Server for example.
